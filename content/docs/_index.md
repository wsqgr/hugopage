# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation section. This template includes three example topics to help you get started:

## Topics

- [Topic 1](topic1) - First example topic with subtopics
- [Topic 2](topic2) - Second example topic with subtopics  
- [Topic 3](topic3) - Third example topic with subtopics

## Getting Started

Each topic contains multiple subtopics demonstrating the hierarchical structure supported by this template. Feel free to modify these examples or create your own topics.

### Creating New Topics

1. Create a new directory under `content/docs/`
2. Add an `_index.md` file with appropriate frontmatter
3. Create subdirectories for subtopics as needed
4. Use relative links to navigate between pages

### Navigation

The Book theme automatically generates a sidebar navigation based on your content structure. Pages are ordered by weight (in frontmatter) or alphabetically if no weight is specified.
